# [Archived] Patch testing for FreeBSD Ports

## THIS REPO IS NO LONGER BEING USED

Migrating to [yzgyyang/freebsd-ports](https://github.com/yzgyyang/freebsd-ports) for my development and testing of ports.

## Introduction

By utilizing ~Cirrus CI~ self-hosted Jenkins infrastructure, this configuration allows easy testing for my individual port patches before committing.

Cirrus CI was used at the beginning, but since there is a hard 2-hour limit for community repos, switched to Jenkins hosted on Microsoft Azure.
